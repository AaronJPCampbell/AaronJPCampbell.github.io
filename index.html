<h1>Aaron Campbell's SNHU ePortfolio</h1>
	<h2>Plan</h2>
		<p>In this course, I will be taking a look at the Final Project for my Mobile Architecture and Programming course.  For this project, I created an app which can track a user’s weight.  However, there is much room for improvement in this app, and I am hoping that by the end of this course I am able to implement everything I am planning.</p>
		<p>First, regarding Software Design and Engineering, there are several improvements I would like to make.  First and foremost, I would like to implement a calorie system which integrates with the weight system.  This would track daily calories similar to weight, and integrate them into the main function of the app.  Going hand in hand with this would be a daily calorie budget, which would update based on how many calories were taken in each day.  I would also like to clean up the UI design of this app.  Right now the UI is very clunky and barebones.  I would like it to be a bit more interesting to look at, as well as flow a bit better from one module/page to the next.</p>
		<p>Next, regarding Algorithms and Data Structure, I would like to implement additional data-related features that one would expect from a fitness app.  One such feature is a module which shows relevant data based on entered weights.  For example, it might show weight data as a line graph for the week, or based on weekly/monthly averages.  I would also like to implement a similar feature for the calorie data, and possibly create an algorithm estimating expected weight loss/gain per day based on calorie data.  This can be expanded to show expected weight loss versus actual weight loss.</p>  
		<p>Finally, regarding Databases, I would like to improve the current method of storing weight data.  Currently, this code accepts any value for the “Date” field, which I will need to update so that it only accepts a certain format.  As it currently stands, the same date can be entered multiple times if the format is different for each.  I would also like to add a feature to look up a specific date to see that day's data.  As mentioned above, I would also like to expand the data stored for each data to include calorie data.</p>  
		<p>By making the above alterations, I believe I can demonstrate all I have learned throughout the computer science program.  The Software Design and Engineering features/enhancements will show that I am capable of creating complex and complete code and that I am capable of expanding the scope of an existing program.  The Algorithms and Data Structure will demonstrate that I am capable of producing and utilizing algorithms based on entered data, and am able to use this to enhance my program.  Finally, the Database features/enhancements will illustrate the best practices I learned during my database-related course(s).  The planned enhancements are all within my capabilities, as they are all based on skills and practices I have learned throughout this program.  I feel that my only concern is regarding the UI enhancements.  In my Mobile Architecture and Programming course, the UI was important, but it was more important to get the code working as intended, so I did not spend as much time looking into UI enhancements for Android Studio.  I plan to look into these for this project, but this particular portion might be rather difficult for me to address.  I currently do not have any questions or concerns which need to be addressed for this project.</p>

	<h2>The Artifact</h2>
		<p>As mentioned above, the artifact I have chosen to work on for this course is a Weight Tracking app I created in a previous class which focused on developing mobile applications.  This artifact was originally created back in June 2022, so I am still a bit familiar with the prior work done on it.</p>
		<p>I selected this artifact in particular as, at the time and currently, it felt like a culmination of many of the other classes I took.  It includes a little bit of everything, from simple coding, object-oriented programming, database utilization, and so on, and I believe that this artifact displays my competency with each of the topics it touches on.  While performing the enhancements on this artifact, I was able to successfully broaden its scope so that it provides the end user with more features on would expect from a fitness app.</p>
	<h2>Software Design and Engineering Enhancements</h2>
		<p>Regarding my proposed Software Design and Engineering enhancements, I was able to complete the calorie tracking system based on my initial plans for it.  This system allows the user to record calories per day, update entries, remove entries, and view all entries.  This new system relies on the date normalization process I mentioned above, which I will discuss in the "Database Enhancements" section.  While I was also able to successfully implement the calorie budget tracking system in the end, I initially struggled with dynamically updating the "Remaining Calories" item I made, and instead had it display a static number.  After taking some time to sift through my code a few times, I was able to work out the bugs that were previously giving me issues.  I realized that the main issue was the placement of certain lines of code.  To put it simply, I made the mistake of updating the values of the necessary variables before the actual math was done, thus leading to either crashes or improper/non-updated values.</p>  
		<p>At this stage, I also began making some minor UI tweaks, but started running into issues with that as well.  For whatever reason, I was really struggled with XML coding in Android Studio.  Any minor tweak to an existing element seemed to cause drastic changes to other unrelated elements.  As a result, I did not implement many significant changes to the UI at this point.</p>
	<h2>Algorithms and Data Structure Enhancements</h2>
	<p>I had an <i>extremely</i> tough time getting these enhancements working.  On my first attempt, nothing really worked as I wanted it to.  I had the code for the weight data line graph implemented (consisting of code initializing the graph, a method to pull specific weight entries to display, and the code to add these weight entries to the graph), but the graph would not show up at all in my app; and the algorithm to calculate expected weight loss was entered into my code, but did not seem to actually work.  Adding to my frustratons was the fact that any minor edit to the aforementioned bits of code almost always resulted in the app crashing on login.  After my initial submission, I spent a good amount of time combing through my code, and finally found the sources of all the errors I was getting.  First, the method I was using to search for individual database entries was set up incorrectly at the ‘query’ level.  Once I adjusted this so it was correct, I was able to successfully pull weight and calorie data from their respective databases based on a specified date.  This allowed me to not only move forward creating my weight data line graph, but also allowed me to complete the calorie budget and projected weight loss algorithms (this allowed me to finalize the Calorie Budget item from the previous enhancement).  Finally, just as with the previous enhancement, I realized my code was ordered incorrectly, and by adjusting that I was able to get everything displayed on the app without any crashes.</p>
	<p>I also made some additional UI enhancements, all very minor (e.g. text size changes) save for one: I added a scrolling effect to the main page of the app.  In the previous enhancement, I realized I was going to run out of room on the page, so I looked into adding the ability to scroll the page.  Thankfully this was a very simple change to make, as all it consisted of was nesting my XML code under a ScrollView layout.</p>
