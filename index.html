<h1>Aaron Campbell's SNHU ePortfolio</h1>
  <h2>Plan</h2>
    <p>In this course, I will be taking a look at the Final Project for my Mobile Architecture and Programming course.  For this project, I created an app which can track a user’s weight.  However, there is much room for improvement in this app, and I am hoping that by the end of this course I am able to implement everything I am planning.</p>
	  <p>First, regarding Software Design and Engineering, there are several improvements I would like to make.  First and foremost, I would like to implement a calorie system which integrates with the weight system.  This would track daily calories similar to weight, and integrate them into the main function of the app.  Going hand in hand with this would be a daily calorie budget, which would update based on how many calories were taken in each day.  I would also like to clean up the UI design of this app.  Right now the UI is very clunky and barebones.  I would like it to be a bit more interesting to look at, as well as flow a bit better from one module/page to the next.</p>
	  <p>Next, regarding Algorithms and Data Structure, I would like to implement additional data-related features that one would expect from a fitness app.  One such feature is a module which shows relevant data based on entered weights.  For example, it might show weight data as a line graph for the week, or based on weekly/monthly averages.  I would also like to implement a similar feature for the calorie data, and possibly create an algorithm estimating expected weight loss/gain per day based on calorie data.  This can be expanded to show expected weight loss versus actual weight loss.</p>  
	  <p>Finally, regarding Databases, I would like to improve the current method of storing weight data.  Currently, this code accepts any value for the “Date” field, which I will need to update so that it only accepts a certain format.  As it currently stands, the same date can be entered multiple times if the format is different for each.  I would also like to add a feature to look up a specific date to see that day's data.  As mentioned above, I would also like to expand the data stored for each data to include calorie data.</p>  
	  <p>By making the above alterations, I believe I can demonstrate all I have learned throughout the computer science program.  The Software Design and Engineering features/enhancements will show that I am capable of creating complex and complete code and that I am capable of expanding the scope of an existing program.  The Algorithms and Data Structure will demonstrate that I am capable of producing and utilizing algorithms based on entered data, and am able to use this to enhance my program.  Finally, the Database features/enhancements will illustrate the best practices I learned during my database-related course(s).  The planned enhancements are all within my capabilities, as they are all based on skills and practices I have learned throughout this program.  I feel that my only concern is regarding the UI enhancements.  In my Mobile Architecture and Programming course, the UI was important, but it was more important to get the code working as intended, so I did not spend as much time looking into UI enhancements for Android Studio.  I plan to look into these for this project, but this particular portion might be rather difficult for me to address.  I currently do not have any questions or concerns which need to be addressed for this project.</p>
