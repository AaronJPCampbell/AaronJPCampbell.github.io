<h1>Aaron Campbell's SNHU ePortfolio Narrative</h1>
	<h2>Plan</h2>
		<p>In this course, I will be taking a look at the Final Project for my Mobile Architecture and Programming course.  For this project, I created an app which can track a user’s weight.  However, there is much room for improvement in this app, and I am hoping that by the end of this course I am able to implement everything I am planning.</p>
		<p>First, regarding Software Design and Engineering, there are several improvements I would like to make.  First and foremost, I would like to implement a calorie system which integrates with the weight system.  This would track daily calories similar to weight, and integrate them into the main function of the app.  Going hand in hand with this would be a daily calorie budget, which would update based on how many calories were taken in each day.  I would also like to clean up the UI design of this app.  Right now the UI is very clunky and barebones.  I would like it to be a bit more interesting to look at, as well as flow a bit better from one module/page to the next.</p>
		<p>Next, regarding Algorithms and Data Structure, I would like to implement additional data-related features that one would expect from a fitness app.  One such feature is a module which shows relevant data based on entered weights.  For example, it might show weight data as a line graph for the week, or based on weekly/monthly averages.  I would also like to implement a similar feature for the calorie data, and possibly create an algorithm estimating expected weight loss/gain per day based on calorie data.  This can be expanded to show expected weight loss versus actual weight loss.</p>  
		<p>Finally, regarding Databases, I would like to improve the current method of storing weight data.  Currently, this code accepts any value for the “Date” field, which I will need to update so that it only accepts a certain format.  As it currently stands, the same date can be entered multiple times if the format is different for each.  I would also like to add a feature to look up a specific date to see that day's data.  As mentioned above, I would also like to expand the data stored for each data to include calorie data.</p>  
		<p>By making the above alterations, I believe I can demonstrate all I have learned throughout the computer science program.  The Software Design and Engineering features/enhancements will show that I am capable of creating complex and complete code and that I am capable of expanding the scope of an existing program.  The Algorithms and Data Structure will demonstrate that I am capable of producing and utilizing algorithms based on entered data, and am able to use this to enhance my program.  Finally, the Database features/enhancements will illustrate the best practices I learned during my database-related course(s).  The planned enhancements are all within my capabilities, as they are all based on skills and practices I have learned throughout this program.  I feel that my only concern is regarding the UI enhancements.  In my Mobile Architecture and Programming course, the UI was important, but it was more important to get the code working as intended, so I did not spend as much time looking into UI enhancements for Android Studio.  I plan to look into these for this project, but this particular portion might be rather difficult for me to address.  I currently do not have any questions or concerns which need to be addressed for this project.</p>
	<h2>The Artifact</h2>

		<br />
		<p>As mentioned above, the artifact I have chosen to work on for this course is a Weight Tracking app I created in a previous class which focused on developing mobile applications.  This artifact was originally created back in June 2022, so I am still a bit familiar with the prior work done on it.</p>
		<p>I selected this artifact in particular as, at the time and currently, it felt like a culmination of many of the other classes I took.  It includes a little bit of everything, from simple coding, object-oriented programming, database utilization, and so on, and I believe that this artifact displays my competency with each of the topics it touches on.  While performing the enhancements on this artifact, I was able to successfully broaden its scope so that it provides the end user with more features on would expect from a fitness app.</p>

	<h2>Software Design and Engineering Enhancements</h2>
		<p>Regarding my proposed Software Design and Engineering enhancements, I was able to complete the calorie tracking system based on my initial plans for it.  This system allows the user to record calories per day, update entries, remove entries, and view all entries.  This new system relies on the date normalization process I mentioned above, which I will discuss in the "Database Enhancements" section.  While I was also able to successfully implement the calorie budget tracking system in the end, I initially struggled with dynamically updating the "Remaining Calories" item I made, and instead had it display a static number.  After taking some time to sift through my code a few times, I was able to work out the bugs that were previously giving me issues.  I realized that the main issue was the placement of certain lines of code.  To put it simply, I made the mistake of updating the values of the necessary variables before the actual math was done, thus leading to either crashes or improper/non-updated values.</p>  
		<p>At this stage, I also began making some minor UI tweaks, but started running into issues with that as well.  For whatever reason, I was really struggled with XML coding in Android Studio.  Any minor tweak to an existing element seemed to cause drastic changes to other unrelated elements.  As a result, I did not implement many significant changes to the UI at this point.</p>
	<h2>Algorithms and Data Structure Enhancements</h2>
		<p>I had an <i>extremely</i> tough time getting these enhancements working.  On my first attempt, nothing really worked as I wanted it to.  I had the code for the weight data line graph implemented (consisting of code initializing the graph, a method to pull specific weight entries to display, and the code to add these weight entries to the graph), but the graph would not show up at all in my app; and the algorithm to calculate expected weight loss was entered into my code, but did not seem to actually work.  Adding to my frustratons was the fact that any minor edit to the aforementioned bits of code almost always resulted in the app crashing on login.  After my initial submission, I spent a good amount of time combing through my code, and finally found the sources of all the errors I was getting.  First, the method I was using to search for individual database entries was set up incorrectly at the ‘query’ level.  Once I adjusted this so it was correct, I was able to successfully pull weight and calorie data from their respective databases based on a specified date.  This allowed me to not only move forward creating my weight data line graph, but also allowed me to complete the calorie budget and projected weight loss algorithms (this allowed me to finalize the Calorie Budget item from the previous enhancement).  Finally, just as with the previous enhancement, I realized my code was ordered incorrectly, and by adjusting that I was able to get everything displayed on the app without any crashes.</p>
		<p>I also made some additional UI enhancements, all very minor (e.g. text size changes) save for one: I added a scrolling effect to the main page of the app.  In the previous enhancement, I realized I was going to run out of room on the page, so I looked into adding the ability to scroll the page.  Thankfully this was a very simple change to make, as all it consisted of was nesting my XML code under a ScrollView layout.</p>	
	<h2>Database Enhancements</h2>
		<p>For the Database Enhacements, my initial plan was to find a way to normalize data entry into the weight database.  My un-enahnced app allowed dates to be entered in whatever manner the user wanted (2/10/23, 2/10/2023, Feb. 10 2023, etc.), which needless to say would cause issues with the data.  I also wanted to create another database to store calorie data, as well as create a function that could look up data based on a specified date (outside of the update and delete functions already present).  As mentioned previously, the calorie database and its related functions had already been implemented at this point, leaving me to work mainly on date normalization.  I was able to implement this by doing the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Setting up a LocalDate variable that was set to the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format</li>
			<li>Altering the code so that, rather than specifying the date when entering new data, the date is set to today’s date instead via the LocalDate variable</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These changes ensured that all data entered into the database had date entries in YYYY-MM-DD format.  This also ensured that data would be entered chronologically, allowing me to employ functions that required the data be in date order (such as the line graph).  In addition to this, the code was previously set up so that any of the updates or deletions of database entries would be rejected if no matching date was found, so the user would need to normalize dates on their end in order to perform operations such as these.  I did face an issue where the LocalDate variable did not behave well with searching the databases, since the dates in them were stored as Strings.  I found the simplest way to fix this was to have another variable which converted today’s date to a String and use that new String variable as the main one.  I also did the same for the 6 days prior to today, so that the line graph could be displayed.</p>
		<p>Finally, regarding the data lookup based on date, I had started work on this for the previous enhancement (it was necessary for some of the algorithms and the line graph to function), but was initially unable to get it working as intended.  After spending a good amount of time trying to figure out what exactly was wrong, I realized that it was simply an incorrect query.  In the weight database lookup method, I initially put:
		<ul>
			<li>Cursor cursor = db.rawQuery("Select weight from WeightDetails where date = ?", new String[] {date});</li>
		</ul>
No matter what I did it seemed this method was causing my app to crash.  Then I decided to make a minor edit:
		<ul>
			<li>Cursor cursor = db.rawQuery("Select * from WeightDetails where date = ?", new String[] {date});</li>
		</ul>
This edit fixed the issues I was experiencing, and allowed me to create the lookup method for the calorie database.</p>

	<h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
		<p>Through the assignments, milestones, and enhancements I have submitted and collected, I have effectively displayed my abilities and have reached the desired course outcomes.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>By putting detailed and frequent comments in my code, I was able to showcase my ability to employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science.  These comments allow collaborators to understand and alter the code as necessary with very little difficulty, as they are able to discern the purpose of the code without studying it extensively.  Also, by uploading my code (original and enhanced) and narratives to Github, it is relatively easy for other users to download and alter the code, as well as upload new branches.</li>
			<li>My initial code review, as well as the narratives for each enhancement, allowed me to design, develop, and deliver professional quality communications regarding my project.  Through my code review, I was able to communicate how I felt my original code met the requirements set forth, as well as discuss my planned improvements.  The written milestone narratives and final narrative allowed me to discuss in detail the enhancement process as well as any difficulties I was encountering.</li>
			<li>While implementing my enhancements, I documented the many issues I ran into.  By doing independent research and brainstorming potential solutions, I was able to not only overcome these challenges and complete my enhancements, but was also able to showcase my ability design and evaluate computing solutions to any problems I face while coding.</li>
			<li>In creating my line graph for weekly weight, I was able to display my ability to utilize innovative techniques, skills, and tools to implement a solution that delivers value.  I was able to manipulate data and search a database so that weekly weight data can be displayed, which is invaluable for a weight tracking app.</li>
			<li>I was able to develop secure code by reviewing my previous code, and making sure that my new code did not present any potential weaknesses.  For example, I made sure that each variable was initialized, and I made sure that all data was normalized as necessary so that invalid data could not lead to a breach (changing variable types as necessary).</li>
